Making my portfolio website using html, CSS, Javascript and react

Creating a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React involves several steps. First, set up your development environment with Node.js and React. Create the project folder, install dependencies, and initialize a React app. Design the layout and structure your portfolio pages using JSX components. Style them using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library. Incorporate JavaScript and React for dynamic elements, animations, and interactivity. Fetch and display your projects and content using state management and props. Optimize performance and ensure responsiveness for various devices. Finally, deploy your portfolio website on a hosting platform like Netlify or GitHub Pages, showcasing your work to the world.
